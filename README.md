# How to Use this Repository

TLDR: Run most* of our visualizations here: https://estephenson.github.io/ai-mental-health/

\* We also have a Python visualization that runs from the command line. The visualization finds the occurence of a given word in the documents and plots a scatterplot of documents in which the word occurs. In order to run that visualization, clone this repository and cd into it. Run the following command: 

python3 Search.py [search word]

Full descriptions of the files: 
1. Running the k-means algorithm: Clustering.py
2. Running the sentiment analysis to get subjectivity scores: Subjectivity.py
3. Creating the Python search visualization: Search.py
4. Creating the D3 visualizations 

The rest of the files are different formats of the data we needed for our visualizations. 

Note: The Python scripts are in Python3 and use sci-kit learn, NLTK, TextBlob and spacy libraries.
