# How to Use this Repository

TLDR: Run most* of our visualizations here: https://estephenson.github.io/ai-mental-health/

\* We also have a Python visualization that runs from the command line. The visualization finds the occurence of a given word in the documents and plots a scatterplot of documents in which the word occurs. In order to run that visualization, clone this repository and cd into it. Run the following command: 

python3 Search.py [search word]
